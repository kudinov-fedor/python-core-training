# In this homework you need to look through different code examples
# Try to run them in python console, experiment 
# Collect questions related to pieces you did not understand

# Also try to write several pytest tests e.g.:

# You have line:   max([2, 3, 1, -2, -5, -8, 12], key=abs)
# And you can write test:

# def test_max_abs():
#     res = max([2, 3, 1, -2, -5, -8, -12], key=abs)
#     assert res == -12


# homework covers:
# math operations for numbers and sequences
# comparison, equality, identity, contains check
# conversion to bool, conditional expression

# builtins:
# all, any, max, min, sorted, filter, id
# abs, divmod, pow, round, sum
# bool, list

# keywords:
# is, not, or, and, in
# if / else
