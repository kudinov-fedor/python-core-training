# It is highly important to solve practical tasks from portals like 'litcode', 'codewars' etc.
# So here I suggest 4 tasks from portal CheckIO 
# so that you could have some taste on how solving of tasks from such kind of portals can look like.
# Also I highly recoment to Sign Up to CheckIO and start solving tasks there.
# As soon as you resolve task all solutions provided by other people become available, 
# which can be treated as greate source material for self studying

# First task 'Multiply' will provide all required information how task should be solved

# Tasks order:
# 1. Multiply
# 2. Fizz Buzz
# 3. Summ Numbers
# 4. Three Words
