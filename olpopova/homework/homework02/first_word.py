You are given a string where you have to find its first word.

When solving a task pay attention to the following points:
    There can be dots and commas in a string.
    A string can start with a letter or, for example, one/multiple dot(s) or space(s).
    A word can contain an apostrophe and it's a part of a word.
    The whole text can be represented with one word and that's it.
