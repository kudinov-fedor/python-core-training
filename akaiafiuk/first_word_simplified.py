"""
You are given a string and you have to find its first word.
This is a simplified version of the First Word mission, which can be solved later.
The input string consists of only English letters and spaces.
There arenâ€™t any spaces at the beginning and the end of the string.

Input: A string.
Output: A string.

Example:
first_word("Hello world") == "Hello"
