"""
You are given a string and two markers (the initial one and final). You have to find a substring enclosed between these two markers. But there are a few important conditions.

This is a simplified version of the Between Markers mission.

The initial and final markers are always different.
The initial and final markers are always 1 char size.
The initial and final markers always exist in a string and go one after another.
Input: Three arguments. All of them are strings. The second and third arguments are the initial and final markers.

Output: A string.
